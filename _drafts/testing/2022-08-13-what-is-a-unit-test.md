When I started writing this article few months ago, I got blocked by the 
idea of I'm going to write about something that everyone knows about and 
everyone can google the topic and found a ton of articles about the same 
basic topic. 
Should I publish such an article? As I said, I got blocked by this idea, the 
thing that stopped me from completing the series I started about [testing](/blog/testing/we-need-more-tests).

Finally, I decided to write this article to explain refer to it in case I 
needed in next articles, at least it will be an internal reference.

## What is a unit test?
You should already know about test automation. Given a piece of code, you 
can write another piece of code that verifies the behavior of the first. The 
second piece of code is called a unit test.

<p class="note">
A unit test should verify a small piece of code in isolation quickly.
