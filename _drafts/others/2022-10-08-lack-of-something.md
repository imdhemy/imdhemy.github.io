When I started to write this article, the title was 'Lack of support'. I feel sometimes I'm lacking of something. I
don't know what it is. I don't know if it's something that I need to change or something that I need to get rid of. Do
am I really lacking of support? Yes and no. Is it the support that I need? or do I need something else, appreciation,
for instance?

I receive a lot of support, and I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful for the people that are there for me. But I have
that feeling of I need something that I don't know what it is!
