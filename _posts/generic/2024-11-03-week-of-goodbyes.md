Change is an inevitable part of any workplace, often bringing both joyful farewells and challenging goodbyes. Recently,
our team experienced this duality with the departure of two colleaguesâ€”one celebrated and cherished, and the other
navigating a more difficult transition. I've been taught a valuable lesson last week!

## Goodbye, Benni

Benjamin Berg, aka Benni, has left Reservix. He was a great colleague, and I wish him all the best for his future.
Although I didn't have the chance to work on the same team as him, I enjoyed sharing the office with him for almost two
years. He was always friendly and helpful. Everyone acknowledges his impact on his team and the company, not only as a
developer but also for his leadership and ability to bring people together. I hope we can stay in touch and go

together.

We had a farewell party at the office. It was emotional and fun, with pizza, drinks, and lots of laughs. Leonie shared a
fun questions box game with us. We had to answer questions like "How many times has this country won the World Cup?"
or "What is the name of this formula?" Rafi was impressive as always, and I was lucky to be on the same team as Benni.

The moment when Carsten gave Benni a present that was collectively bought by the team was very emotional. Benni was
especially happy when he saw a device that he wanted to try to automate his home. That was a great idea from Wiktor.
They were creative enough to give him a soundboard with some funny sounds to remind him of our soundboard in the office.

## Another team member moves on

Last week wasn't easy for our team. The team decided to go to different ways with one our colleagues. She was a good
developer, but we couldn't find a way to continue working together. I hope she finds a new job soon. I wish her all the
best.

At the end of the day, the people will remember how you made them feel, it's not about how good you are at your job.
It's also crucial to [pay attention to the feedback]({% post_url 2024-03-30-the-pipeline-ate-my-code %}) you receive and
to be open to change.
