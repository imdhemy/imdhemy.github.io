I always liked dark themes, but I came across
this [blog post](https://stitcher.io/blog/why-light-themes-are-better-according-to-science) by Brent, and I thought I'd
give it a try. I installed the Light lite theme on my PHPStorm and WebStorm. In the beginning, it wasn't comfortable,
but I thought I just needed to get used to it and I could
even [modify the theme](https://github.com/imdhemy/phpstorm-light-lite-theme) to my liking.

I pushed myself to use it for around two months, but I couldn't get used to it. Finally, I decided to go back to the
dark theme. I'm using the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) theme, and I'm happy with it.

Whenever I google for "Dark theme vs Light theme", I get a lot of articles, and YouTube videos, saying that light themes
are better for your eyes. I don't know if that's true, but I know that I'm more productive with dark themes.

It could be because I'm from the old school of using white chalk on a blackboard? ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜…
