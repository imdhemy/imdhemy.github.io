    <p>Well, you probably know that I‚Äôm an immigrant in Germany. I‚Äôve been living here for almost two years. I can count the
number of connections I have in this country on my fingers, and my middle finger is enough to count the number of
friends I have. To add to that, all of them are from work. People around think I‚Äôm a workaholic, but the truth is, I‚Äôm
not. I just don‚Äôt know what to do with my time. I have some hobbies, but I developed them in a way that I can do them
alone. For a long time in Egypt, I had many friends, tons of connections, and was quite popular in my city, but I always
felt like a circle in a square hole.</p>

<p>Back to my hobbies: I‚Äôm a bookworm üêõ, I love reading, and I read a lot! I also love video games and chess. But, you
know, I started to play chess after I immigrated, and I play it online. I‚Äôm not even used to a physical chessboard.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a social person with a sense of humor; that‚Äôs what people say about me. I‚Äôm also a good listener. One of my exes -
and I have many! - called me a ‚Äúpsychologist.‚Äù Sometimes, I feel like I don‚Äôt know how to make friends. I‚Äôve always been
the one who was approached, even with girls. For sure, I‚Äôve tried to approach some, but I always lose interest. I
probably have a fear of rejection that I enclose in a shell of indifference. I‚Äôm not a shy person; I‚Äôm straightforward.
I say what I think, I don‚Äôt like to play games, and sometimes I‚Äôm rude‚Ä¶ no, many times‚Ä¶ Haha! I commit and then I
regret!</p>

<p>Enough about me. I‚Äôm here to talk about the hole I‚Äôve realized I have in my life. When I came to Germany, I was so
excited and I still am, but I didn‚Äôt realize that I was leaving behind a big part of me: my family, my friends, my bike.
Here in Germany, I have better opportunities, but something is missing. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm not happy, but I‚Äôm not
satisfied. I don‚Äôt blame Germany. I came here already with a heavy heart. üíî</p>

<p>My first week in Germany was just after Salsabil, my ex, left me. I was devastated. I communicated with everyone that I
would start a new life in Germany and never look back. I thought it was just a matter of time until I learned <a href="/blog/germany/from-code-to-german.html/">the
language</a> and would be able to make friends. I was wrong. Yeah, I haven‚Äôt
learned the language yet, but I‚Äôve seen many
immigrants who speak German fluently, and they still complain about the same thing. Am I wrong? I don‚Äôt know, but I will
keep trying.</p>

<p>From time to time, I receive notifications from Google Photos, reminding me of memories I had with Salsabil. To be
honest, I spend hours looking at these photos with mixed feelings. I miss her, but I‚Äôm comfortable not being with her.
She is a good person, but we were not meant to be together. For me, she was the one, but she didn‚Äôt accept my
weaknesses, my hopes, my dreams. I always felt exposed; the door was always open, and I was threatened to be scandalized
at any moment. She meant it or not, but I felt it. Anyway, she left‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not a workaholic, but there‚Äôs a hole in my life, and I need to fill it‚Ä¶ soon.</p>
