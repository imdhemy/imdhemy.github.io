<div class="m-auto max-w-screen-md bg-white p-5 text-xl content">
    <p>For years, I have been dedicated to writing code every day and contributing to various
projects. <a href="https://github.com/imdhemy">My GitHub account</a> showcases my commitment and hard work. Since I moved
from Egypt to Frankfurt am Main, Germany, I’ve decided to do the same with learning German, but Unfortunately, I
couldn’t keep doing both at the same time. I had to choose one of them, and I decided to take a break from coding and
focus on learning the German language. It’s not a complete break, though. I will still be contributing to open source
projects, and I’m writing code every day in my job, But I mean a break from that habit of writing code every day for
open source projects.</p>

<p>As an expat in a foreign country, learning the local language is vital not only for practical purposes but also for
understanding the culture better. I have tried learning a new language in the past, particularly Turkish, but I failed
to do so. However, I have faith that German is different, and my background in English, which has some similarities with
German, may give me an edge.</p>

<p>To begin my language learning journey, I set a goal to finish one lesson per week from
the <a href="https://www.hueber.de/menschen">Menschen book</a>, a popular German language textbook for adults and young adults
designed according to the latest findings in educational psychology as they describe it.</p>

<p>I already tried some applications like Duolingo and Babbel, but I didn’t like them. I prefer a more structured approach
to learning a new language. I want to learn the language in a way similar to how I learned English which I learned from
the “Hello” series of books.</p>

<p>I’ve just completed my first lesson, and it feels like a great accomplishment. The first lesson introduced me to the
basics of the German language, such as the alphabet, how to ask about names, how say “how are you” and so on.</p>

<p>In addition to the book, I planned to practice speaking German for 10 minutes every day. My first attempt was
challenging, I couldn’t pronounce correctly, and I was quite nervous. I’m not sure if I will be able to do it every day,
but I will try my best.</p>

<p>Learning a new language is challenging, and I’ve already encountered some difficulties, particularly with the
pronunciation of some German words. However, I’m optimistic that with persistence and hard work, I’ll be able to master
the language.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe that taking the first step towards learning a new language is always the hardest, but it’s also
the most important. If you’re thinking of learning a new language, don’t be afraid to start, even if it’s just for ten
minutes a day. You’ll be amazed at how much progress you can make with consistent effort. Believe me, I did the same
with coding, and I gained a lot of experience and knowledge. Hopefully, I’ll be able to do the same with German.</p>
