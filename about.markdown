I wasn't planning to become a Software Engineer. I was a medical student at one of the top medical schools in the middle east, [Kasr Alainy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasr_El_Eyni_Hospital).

In October. 2011 I started to study Computer science. I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor's degree in computer science, and I was ranked the first in my class.

It was a hard shift, especially in our oriental society, but I did it!

Let me tell you why I see myself as a **Software Artist**. As per Wikipedia, art is a diverse range of (and products of) human activities involving creative imagination to express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. That is definitely what Software Developers do! Every developer is an artist, not just me.

So why a **real-life superhero**? Life is very challenging in any third-world country. In such countries, if you can put food on the table, you are a superhero.  A real-life superhero!

I'm the **creator and the maintainer** of the [Laravel in-app purchase](https://imdhemy.com/laravel-iap-docs/) package, besides the two packages used under the hood for Google Play and App Store.

I'm also the **founder** of the [Piscibus](https://github.com/piscibus) open-source organization, where we create the e-creatures of the see. Feel free to request joining us.

On December, 9th 2020, my son gave birth. He is called **Mohaia**. Good to mention on that day I felt the real meaning of _"Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world"_. I wish to be a good father!

My story is to be continued.
