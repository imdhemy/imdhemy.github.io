I wasn’t planning to become a Software Engineer. I was a medical student at one of the top medical schools in the middle east,  [Kasr Alainy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasr_El_Eyni_Hospital).

In October 2011 I started to study Computer science. I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science and was ranked the first in my class.

It was a hard shift, especially in our oriental society, but I did it!

Let me tell you why I see myself as a **Software Artist**. As per Wikipedia, art is a diverse range of (and products of) human activities involving creative imagination to express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas. That is definitely what Software Developers do! Every developer is an artist, not just me.

I'm the **creator and the maintainer** of the [Laravel in-app purchase](https://imdhemy.com/laravel-iap-docs/) package, besides the two packages used under the hood for Google Play and App Store.

I'm also the **founder** of the [Piscibus](https://github.com/piscibus) open-source organization, where we create the e-creatures of the sea. Feel free to request joining us.

On December, 9, 2020, my son was born. He is called Mohaia. Good to mention, on that day I felt the real meaning of _“Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world.”_.

I wish to be a good father!

My story is to be continued..
