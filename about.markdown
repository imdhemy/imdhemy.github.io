Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Mohamad Eldhemy, but you can just call me Dhemy — everyone else does!
😊
I started this blog to share my thoughts, feelings, experiences, and the occasional existential crisis—think of it as my
online diary. 📖

I’m a software developer with over a decade of experience, currently serving as a senior developer at Reservix GmbH. 💻
Here, I tackle everything from personal life to programming, PHP, JavaScript, algorithms, data structures, testing, and
self-development. You name it, I’ve probably written about it—or will soon!

My mission? To inspire you, share some knowledge, and throw in a few best practices along the way. I’d love for you to
get to know me better through my ramblings! 🤗

Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:imdhemy@gmail.com); I promise I don’t bite! When I'm not busy blogging,
you’ll
find me reading, playing PUBG on PS4, or challenging myself in a game of chess. 🎮♟️

In everything I do, I strive for excellence and continuous improvement. 🌟 So, grab a coffee (or tea), make yourself
comfortable, and enjoy your stay! ☕️

Cheers,

Dhemy - 26th October 2024
