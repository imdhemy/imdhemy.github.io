<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    I started by reading and studying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108986.Introduction_to_Algorithms"> Introduction to Algorithms</a>.
    It's not an easy book to read yet understand. Though it's the being introduced to undergraduate students.
</p>

<p>
    After a while, I met a guy who works for Facebook. I told him about my plan and he said:
</p>

<blockquote>If you can understand this book, come and teach me!</blockquote>

<p>
    He advised me to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425208.The_Algorithm_Design_Manual">The algorithm design manual</a> instead.
</p>

<p>
    While reading the Red book, as I call it, I started to implement Data structures by following this playlist.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM">Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course - Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer
    </a>. As you can imagine, I was complicating the process for myself, but I realised that after a long time of study, stop restart from the beginning process.
</p>

<h2>The turning point</h2>

<p>
    A friend shared with me the <a href="https://interviews.school/">Interviews.school</a>, which should be a complete interview preparation guide.
    I found it's good, and decided to follow it. The plan was, follow the interviews school guide to have an overview about every type of problem
    that you can meet in an interview. And it worked!
</p>

<p>
    Interviews.school wasn't enough for me, but it helped me to have a good idea about what to focus on!
